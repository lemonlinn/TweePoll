# TweePoll
A flask based localhost website that visualizes real-time twitter sentiment filtered by a user inputted hashtag.

# Work In Progress
Right now, it basically just prints a json file of tweet information every couple of seconds. I'm using this project to build my web development skills, as well as my understanding of server/client communication. This is my first time coding in node.js and javascript. How exciting!

## Next Steps:
1. Increase the rate of pings so that the updates are actually real-time
2. Build data structure in javascript to hold pongs
3. Convert data into visualizations
